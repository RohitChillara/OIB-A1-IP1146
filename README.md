Oasis Infobyte java development tasks
I have created few small projects under the internship for Java Development offered by OASIS INFOBYTE, this repository contains the source code to my projects.


The projects which I have done for the internship are:


1.Reservation System:
This system is capable of storing the information of the passengers who have a booking. This helps them to keep all of their booking details at one place which makes it easier to manage and access.
For this I have used the concepts of Java JDBC and MySQL.
**MySQL-**This software was used to create a database where passenger information can be stored, managed and accessed.

**JDBC(Java Database connectivity)-**This helped to automate the query process by connecting the java program to the SQL server.
The pre written java queries are made in a way which suffice the user requirements and process them to the Database.
Significance of the project:
This projects takes basic input like passenger name, gender, age, date of travel, source, destination ,train number and train name.
It significantly reduces the stress for the user where he can be free of creating a database and learning SQL to communicate with it and manage it.
That process is taken care by the project.

2.Guess The Number:
This is a basic project where the user has to enter a number ranging from 1 to 100, and computer picks up a random number between the same range. If both the input and the random number by computer match the user scores a point.

Features:

1.User can pick the number of attempts he wishes to play.

2.The program tells if the number guessed was higher or lower than the random number.
3.Score is displayed at the end.
